in jenkins --> pre build, build, post build


dashboard -> nodes -> configure node monitors( to check free disk space,..)
dashboard -> nodes -> built in nodes( to configure nodes)


freestyle job  disadvantages(ecerything in console)
--------------------------
1. anyone can login and do the changes, difficult to track what went wrong
2. difficult to restore
3. I can't see the history, no versions

scripted way
----------------
1. review can be done before do something.
2. easy to restore
3. track the changes
4. maintains the history

master and slave
master and node architecture

two options b/w master and agent
------------------------------------
1. when work is there, master calls agent and ask them to do work(push bases and best)
2. daily agent comes to master and ask if there is any work

In agent java is required to support master

to distribute work for agents:
-------------------------
managejenkins -> nodes -> newnode 
in newnode  main fields:
    remote directory: /home/ec2-user/jenkins-agent(path should in acceesbile location i.e. permissions and modes of path)
    labels:
    lauchmethod: ssh
we check in logs for connection verification
